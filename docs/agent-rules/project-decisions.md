# Project Decisions

This file records defaults until the user chooses otherwise.

## Current Defaults

- App name: `Trace`
- Repository: `seungchan2022/Trace`
- Platform: iOS
- Language: Swift
- UI framework: SwiftUI
- Minimum iOS version: iOS 17.0
- Xcode project: `Trace.xcodeproj`
- Xcode scheme: `Trace`
- Bundle identifier: `com.luke.Trace`
- Test targets: `TraceTests`, `TraceUITests`
- Test framework: XCTest
- Presentation architecture: MVVM
- Dependency injection: `DependencyContainer` with protocol-based services
- Architecture direction: page-first MVVM presentation with Clean Architecture boundaries
- Modularization: not active yet, but code should be structured so `Domain`, `Application`, `Infrastructure`, and `Pages` can later move into Swift Package modules
- Persistence: undecided
- Backend: none by default
- Authentication: none by default
- Analytics: none by default
- Monetization: none by default
- Product focus: plan a running route before the run, not record completed runs
- First MVP: tap start and destination on a map, show an actual walking route and total distance
- Course planning provider for MVP: Apple `MapKit` / `MKDirections` with `.walking`
- Course planning provider architecture: port-and-adapter via `CoursePlanningServiceProtocol`
- Course planning domain boundary: course planning models live under `Trace/Domain/CoursePlanning/Entity`; course planning protocols live under `Trace/Domain/CoursePlanning/Protocol`
- Course planning infrastructure boundary: concrete provider adapters live under `Trace/Infrastructure/CoursePlanning/{Provider}`
- Course planner page boundary: page code lives under `Trace/Pages/CoursePlannerPage`; page-only subviews live under `UIComponent` and use `{PageName}Page+{Role}Component.swift` filenames
- Course planner state: iOS 17+ Observation API with `@Observable`, not `ObservableObject` / `@Published`
- Course planner concurrency: Swift 6 style `async`/`await` with `@MainActor` UI state isolation
- Planning/spec document language: Korean by default
- Development tooling: Codex and Claude Code are used interchangeably across sessions; rules, prompts, plans, and git are shared in the repo, while only the entry file (`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`) and the command directory are tool-specific. See `docs/agent-rules/dual-tool.md`.
- Workflow plugins: `superpowers`, `compound-engineering`, and `XcodeBuildMCP` are installed in both tools; every execute→review cycle ends with `ce-compound` to capture reusable lessons. See `docs/agent-rules/skills.md` and `docs/prompts/setup-claude.md`.

## Decisions the User May Need to Make Later

- Whether data is local-only or synced
- Whether login is required
- Privacy constraints
- App icon/name/subtitle
- Whether TestFlight, App Store release, or private use is the target
- When to replace `MapKit` with a Korea-focused map/routing provider
- When to add course saving after the route planner MVP works

## Decision Policy

- If a decision affects architecture, privacy, persistence, account creation, cost, or App Store behavior, ask the user.
- If a decision is only local code style or project organization, choose the documented default and update this file.
